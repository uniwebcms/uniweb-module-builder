# Uniweb Components

A Uniweb Component is a React JS component whose props are 4 objets: `profile`, `block`, `page` , and `website`. The `profile` object represents the source data of a website. The `block` object contains the settings for the component, which is considered a **building block** within a webpage. The `page` object provides information about the current webpage being rendered as a sequence of buildign blocks. Finally, the `website` provides information about the entire website. Most components only need to work with the `profile` and `block` props.
